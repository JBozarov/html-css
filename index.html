      <p>Little bit about myself, I grew up in Asia, I came 
         to the United States 10 years ago, I like having a balance 
         between hard work and 
         fun and some of the hobbies that I do for fun are 
         hiking and enjoying nature and playing soccer to stay 
         in shape. 
         Another fact about myself is that I originally studied 
         Accounting because I enjoyed solving problems with 
         numbers, but over time I learned that I could apply 
         that same critical thinking and numeric skills into 
         coding projects and found that I have a greater 
         passion for programming.
